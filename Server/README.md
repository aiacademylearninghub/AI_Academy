# Server Directory

This directory contains the backend code for the AI Academy project. Below is a detailed explanation of each file and its purpose to help AI systems or developers understand the structure and functionality.

## File Explanations

- **src/**  
  Main source code for the server application.
  - **index.js / server.js**  
    Entry point for the backend server. Initializes the server and sets up middleware.
  - **routes/**

  - **config/**  
    Configuration files for environment variables, database connections, etc.
  - **utils/**

- **package.json**  
  Lists dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the server project.

- **README.md**

## How It Works

The server is a RESTful API built with Node.js (Express or similar framework). It handles HTTP requests from the client, processes data, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
